"""Flask server for the line-by-line Python execution observer.

Runs trusted local Python code in a dedicated subprocess (tracer.py) and
exposes a small JSON API:

  POST /api/run        {code}                       -> {run_id}
  POST /api/step       {run_id, pause_seq}          -> 200 | 409
  POST /api/continue   {run_id, pause_seq}          -> 200 | 409
  POST /api/terminate  {run_id}                     -> 200 | 409
  GET  /api/state                                   -> full run snapshot

Only one unfinished run is allowed at a time. Step/continue are accepted
at most once per pause; duplicate or stale requests are rejected with 409
and do not advance execution.

Concurrency model
-----------------
A single condition variable (COND) serialises run startup, termination and
event reading.  Each Run carries a child-process lifecycle:

  starting  -> status active ("running"), proc may not be assigned yet
  active    -> proc assigned, reader thread consumes events
  terminal  -> finished | exception | terminated (sticky, never goes back)
  reaped    -> the child process has been waited on (no zombie, no survivor)

Guarantees:

* terminate returns success only after the child is dead and reaped; a
  terminate that arrives while Popen is still in flight is remembered and
  the starter kills the freshly created child itself, so an unfinished
  start can never leave a process behind.
* a new run is registered only when there is no current run or the current
  run's child has been fully reaped.  Starters parked waiting for a previous
  child to be reaped re-check admission against whatever run is current when
  they wake (a replacement run may itself already be terminal but unreaped),
  so a successor is never registered or spawned while a previous child is
  still alive or being reaped; a wait timeout is a 409 that leaves the
  current run untouched.
* late events (a pause already buffered in the pipe when the child was
  killed) are discarded once the run is terminal or no longer current, so
  they can never flip terminated/finished back to an active state.
